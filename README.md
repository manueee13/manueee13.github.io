My cozy little space on the web 💻🌸 — a mix of **cybersecurity**, **CTF adventures**.

## 💫 Overview

Here I collect my **CTF and HackTheBox writeups** — not just as trophies, but as stories of how I solved each challenge.  
They’re meant for anyone curious about my process or who just wants to learn something new from real examples.

I’ll also be posting **articles and scripts** about cybersecurity and other projects I’m working on — still a **WIP**, but it’s slowly taking shape.

## ⚙️ Tech Notes

Built with **[Astro 5](https://astro.build/)** — because I like things clean, fast, and aesthetically satisfying.  
The site is fully static and easy to navigate, with a structure focused on clarity and good vibes.

## 💖 Philosophy

This isn’t just a tech blog — it’s my digital reflection: structured yet soft, logical yet emotional.  
Every post mixes curiosity, design, and the queer sparkle of someone who codes in eyeliner and drinks too much coffee ☕💅
